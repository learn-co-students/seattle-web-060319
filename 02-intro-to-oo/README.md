Intro to Object Orientation
===========================

aka: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Ability to define and create object and program them to do different stuff.
- Collection of data and d variables and stuff that live together in memory.
- coding through the perpesctive (of something). of the object.
- Every object has a set of methods.
  - using methods to relate objects to other objects.
  - attributes.

## SWBATs

* [ ] Define `object` in programming domain
* [ ] Explain the concept of sending messages
* [ ] Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
* [ ] Explain the difference between a class and an instance
* [ ] Pass arguments to `new` by defining an initialize method in class
* [ ] Create instance methods
* [ ] Call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`
* [ ] Define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros
* [ ] Get more practice with array compositions (`each`, `map`, `select`, `find`)
* [ ] Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables



### Objects!

- real world (attributes, methods)
  - organizing information, abstraction
- in programming (type, value of objects)
- Everything is an object
- methods: how do they work?
    - messages, send, respond, do work
- unknown methods? what happens?

### Objects, Classes, and Instances, Oh My!

- programmers are lazy
- hashes to classes, encapsulation
- class, objects, and instances: how are they related?
- `object_id`

### Creating our own Objects

- getters and setters
- instance variables, instance methods, scoping
- `attr_` macros, initialize
- more instance methods
  - implicit `self`
- class methods, class variables
  - `@@all`, `self`
  - how do we write `Human.all`?
### Practice with Iterators

#Hashes vs Objects

# Hashes
{ key1: val1, key2: val2}
- print out keys vs having a bunch of data being stored
- references keys more easily.
- Organizational
- Better than an array.
- Discover the whole dataset when represented.
